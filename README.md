<br/>
4. Number of Instances: There are a total of 7050 instances (rows) in the dataset.
<br/>

At first some amount of EDA has been done to find some correlations between the different attributes of the dataset.
The dataset has been preprocessed to handle the missing values. Then a K-means model has been trained using a set of attributes from the dataset to group the Facebook Live sellers in clusters. The appropriate value of the the number of clusters has been determined using the Elbow Method. PCA has also been used to visualise the cluster distribution.
